# Placeholder Text Issue Debug Report

## Problem Description
The PropertyBasicsScreen is still showing hardcoded placeholder text despite multiple attempts to remove it:
- "e.g., Sunset Apartments Unit 4B" in Property Name
- "123 Main Street" in Street Address  
- "Apt 4B, Unit 101, Suite 200" in Unit field
- "San Francisco" in City
- "12345" in ZIP Code

## What Should Be Happening
All fields should be completely blank with empty placeholder strings.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### 1. PropertyBasicsScreen.tsx Import
```typescript
import PropertyAddressFormSimplified from '../../components/forms/PropertyAddressFormSimplified';
```

### 2. PropertyBasicsScreen.tsx Usage
```typescript
<PropertyAddressFormSimplified
  value={addressData}
  onChange={setAddressData}
  onSubmit={() => {}} // No submit needed here
  sectionId="property"
/>
```

### 3. PropertyAddressFormSimplified.tsx Component
**All placeholder values are set to empty strings:**
```typescript
placeholder=""
```

### 4. Current addressData State
```typescript
const [addressData, setAddressData] = useState<Address>({
  propertyName: '',
  fullName: '',
  organization: '',
  addressLine1: '',
  addressLine2: '',
  city: '',
  state: '',
  postalCode: '',
  country: 'US',
  email: '',
  phone: ''
});
```

## Potential Issues

### Issue 1: Browser Cache
- Metro bundler cache cleared multiple times
- Browser hard refresh attempted
- Incognito mode suggested

### Issue 2: Component Not Actually Rendering
The screenshot shows the old form structure, suggesting PropertyAddressFormSimplified is not being rendered at all.

### Issue 3: Navigation or Routing Issue
The user might be viewing a cached page or different route.

### Issue 4: React Native Web Rendering Issue
The component might have rendering issues specific to web platform.

## Diagnostic Steps Needed

### Step 1: Verify Component Import
Check if PropertyAddressFormSimplified is actually being imported and rendered.

### Step 2: Check Console Errors
Look for any JavaScript errors preventing the new component from rendering.

### Step 3: Verify Route
Ensure the user is on the correct PropertyBasicsScreen route.

### Step 4: Check Component Export
Verify PropertyAddressFormSimplified is properly exported as default.

### Step 5: Temporary Debug Render
Add a visible debug element to confirm the new component is rendering.

## Immediate Fix Strategy

### Option 1: Add Debug Text
Add a visible debug marker to PropertyAddressFormSimplified to confirm it's rendering.

### Option 2: Check for Multiple Components
Search for any other address form components that might be rendering instead.

### Option 3: Inline Fix
Temporarily inline the form fields with empty placeholders directly in PropertyBasicsScreen.

## Files to Check
1. `/src/screens/landlord/PropertyBasicsScreen.tsx` - Main screen
2. `/src/components/forms/PropertyAddressFormSimplified.tsx` - New form component
3. `/src/navigation/MainStack.tsx` - Routing configuration
4. Browser Developer Tools - Console errors
5. React DevTools - Component tree inspection

## Next Actions Required
1. Verify PropertyAddressFormSimplified is actually rendering
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Inspect React component tree
4. If component isn't rendering, investigate why
5. If component is rendering but showing wrong text, check for conflicting CSS or cached values
