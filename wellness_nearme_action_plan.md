I noticed [Clinic Name] on Google and wanted to reach out about a

Here's how it works:

• You pay $100-150 per booked appointment (only when they show up)
• Zero upfront cost, cancel anytime

Most clinics convert 40-60% of our leads to patients worth $2,500-3,600
lifetime value.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week to discuss becoming
our exclusive [City] partner?

Best,

## Critical Success Factors

### 🎯 Must-Haves for Success

1. **Speed to Market**
   - Launch MVP in 14 days, not 90 days
   - Validate with real money (ads) by day 20
   - First partnership by day 15

2. **Focus on ONE Niche First**
   - TRT has highest immediate ROI
   - Master it before expanding
   - Resist temptation to launch 5 domains at once

3. **Clinic Relationships Are Everything**
   - They control supply (appointments)
   - Happy partners = more referrals
   - Under-promise, over-deliver on lead quality

4. **Conversion Optimization > Traffic**
   - 100 visitors at 20% conversion = 20 leads
   - 1,000 visitors at 2% conversion = 20 leads
   - Fix conversion before scaling ads

5. **Cash Flow Management**
   - Get paid weekly from clinics (not net-30)
   - Reinvest first $20k into growth
   - Keep 3 months runway in bank

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Top Risks & Countermeasures

**Risk 1: Clinics don't convert leads**
- **Mitigation:** Pre-qualify leads heavily (insurance, location, seriousness)
- **Mitigation:** Provide lead nurturing templates to clinics
- **Mitigation:** Only work with clinics that have good reviews/track record

**Risk 2: Google algorithm change kills SEO**
- **Mitigation:** Diversify traffic (ads, social, referrals)
- **Mitigation:** Build brand recognition (not just SEO)
- **Mitigation:** Focus on helpful content, not just keywords

**Risk 3: Low traffic/high customer acquisition cost**
- **Mitigation:** Start with Google Ads (guaranteed traffic)
- **Mitigation:** Use EMD advantage for faster organic rankings
- **Mitigation:** Content marketing compounds over time

**Risk 4: Payment disputes with clinics**
- **Mitigation:** Crystal clear contract on what's a "qualified lead"
- **Mitigation:** Use third-party tracking (call recording, form submission logs)
- **Mitigation:** Offer trial period (first 5 leads free to prove value)

**Risk 5: Competitor launches same model**
- **Mitigation:** First-mover advantage (lock in best clinics)
- **Mitigation:** Build moat through content + backlinks
- **Mitigation:** Create exclusive partnerships (no competing directories)

## Questions to Ask Yourself Before Starting

1. **Can I commit 20-30 hours/week for 90 days?**
   - If no, wait until you can or find a co-founder

2. **Do I have $2,000-5,000 to invest?**
   - If no, bootstrap with free tools or presell to clinics

3. **Am I comfortable with sales/outreach?**
   - If no, hire a sales VA immediately or find sales co-founder

4. **Can I handle 3-6 months before meaningful income?**
   - If no, keep day job, do this nights/weekends

5. **Am I patient enough to build SEO over 6-12 months?**
   - If no, focus 100% on paid ads + partnerships

**If you answered YES to all 5:** You're ready to execute this plan.

**If you answered NO to 2+:** Adjust the plan or reconsider timing.

## Conclusion: Your Competitive Advantage

**Why You'll Win:**

1. **Market Timing:** Wellness is exploding, directories don't exist yet
2. **Exact Match Domains:** 60% SEO advantage from day one
3. **84.7% Domain Availability:** Competitors haven't noticed the opportunity
4. **Fragmented Market:** No ZocDoc for wellness = blue ocean
5. **High LTV, High Intent:** Healthcare leads convert at premium rates
6. **Capital Efficient:** Can launch for <$3,000 and be profitable month 1

**The biggest risk is not execution - it's waiting too long and losing first-mover advantage.**

**Recommended Next Action:**
Set aside 2 hours today, grab coffee, and make your first 10 clinic outreach calls.

If 2+ say "yes, send me leads," register your domain and start building.
