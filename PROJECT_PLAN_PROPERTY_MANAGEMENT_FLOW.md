## 🛠 Technical Implementation Guide

### **Reusable Patterns (from PropertyBasicsScreen):**

```typescript
// Progress Management
const useScreenProgress = (currentStep: number, totalSteps: number) => {
  const percentage = (currentStep / totalSteps) * 100;
  const timeRemaining = estimateTimeRemaining(currentStep);
  return { percentage, timeRemaining, stepText: `${currentStep} of ${totalSteps}` };
};

// Camera Service Pattern
const useCameraCapture = (options: CameraOptions) => {
  const [photos, setPhotos] = useState<Photo[]>([]);
  const capturePhoto = async () => { /* implementation */ };
  const deletePhoto = (index: number) => { /* implementation */ };
  return { photos, capturePhoto, deletePhoto };
};

// Navigation Pattern
const NavigationFooter = ({ onBack, onContinue, canContinue, saveStatus }) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.footer}>
      <SaveStatus status={saveStatus} />
      <Button title="Back" onPress={onBack} variant="secondary" />
      <Button title="Continue" onPress={onContinue} disabled={!canContinue} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

### **Design System Consistency:**
- **Colors**: #28A745 (primary), #DC3545 (error), #F8F9FA (background)
- **Typography**: ResponsiveTitle (28px), ResponsiveBody (16px)
- **Spacing**: 16px/24px/32px hierarchy
- **Components**: ResponsiveContainer, ProgressBar, SaveStatus

## 🔄 Risk Management & Contingencies

### **High-Risk Items:**
1. **AI Asset Detection** - Fallback to manual entry if integration fails
2. **Camera Performance** - Comprehensive testing across device types
3. **Memory Management** - Progressive compression and cleanup
4. **User Completion Rate** - Continuous UX validation and adjustment

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Weekly validation checkpoints** with user feedback
- **Incremental feature delivery** with fallback options
- **Performance monitoring** throughout development
- **Cross-platform testing** at each phase
