EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Codex Handoff

PROJECT: MyAILandlord - Clerk to Supabase Auth Migration
BRANCH: migration/clerk-to-supabase-auth
STATUS: Migration complete ✅, needs bug fixes & testing ⚠️

WHAT'S DONE:
- Removed all Clerk code (65 files, 4,835 deletions)
- Integrated Supabase Auth throughout app
- Database migrated (2 SQL files ready)
- Zero Clerk imports remaining
- Enhanced realtime subscriptions with user filtering

WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:
1. Critical (90min): Validate DB migrations work, test auth flows
2. High (1.5hr): Fix Jest config, ESLint config  
3. Medium (9.5hr): Fix 77 TypeScript errors (prioritized list)
4. Medium (6hr): Build test coverage for auth

TOTAL EFFORT: ~22 hours
MINIMUM VIABLE: 3 hours (just critical validation)

DETAILED PLAN: See CODEX_HANDOFF.md
- Forced-rank priority order
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples for fixes
- Success criteria for each phase

START HERE: Phase 1.1 - Database Migration Verification
1. Apply 2 SQL migrations in Supabase
2. Test signup creates profile correctly
3. Verify RLS policies block unauthorized access

BLOCKER QUESTIONS:
- Do RPC functions validate_property_code and link_tenant_to_property accept tenant_id param?
- Should we downgrade React 19 to fix Jest compatibility?
- What's the production deployment timeline?

FILES TO REVIEW:
- CODEX_HANDOFF.md (full plan)
- MIGRATION_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md (what's been verified)
- src/context/SupabaseAuthContext.tsx (new auth system)
- supabase/migrations/20250115_*.sql (database changes)

READY TO START: Yes, migration code is stable and committed.
