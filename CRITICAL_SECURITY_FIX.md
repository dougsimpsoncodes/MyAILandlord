# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIX REQUIRED IMMEDIATELY üö®

## URGENT: Database Security is COMPLETELY BROKEN

### Current Status: **UNSAFE FOR ANY USE** ‚ùå

The Row Level Security (RLS) policies have **NOT been applied** to the Supabase database. This means:

- ‚ùå **ANY user can access ALL data in the database**
- ‚ùå **Tenants can see other tenants' maintenance requests**  
- ‚ùå **Landlords can see other landlords' properties**
- ‚ùå **All user profiles and messages are publicly accessible**
- ‚ùå **The application has NO data security whatsoever**

## IMMEDIATE STEPS TO FIX (DO THIS NOW):

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: "My AI Landlord"
3. Go to SQL Editor in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Apply Schema (if not done)
```sql
-- Run the complete schema first
-- Copy and paste contents of: supabase-schema.sql
```

### Step 3: Apply RLS Policies (CRITICAL)
```sql
-- Copy and paste the ENTIRE contents of: supabase-rls-policies.sql
-- This file contains ALL the security policies that protect user data
```

### Step 4: Apply Storage Setup
```sql
-- Copy and paste contents of: supabase-storage-setup.sql
```

### Step 5: Verify Security is Working
After applying the policies, run this test:

```javascript
// This should return 0 rows (empty) when RLS is working
const { data } = await supabase.from('profiles').select('*');
console.log('Accessible profiles:', data?.length || 0); // Should be 0
```

## WHY THIS HAPPENED

The SQL files exist in the codebase but were never executed in the Supabase database. The application code assumes RLS is working, but the database has no security configured.

## AFTER FIXING

Once RLS is properly applied:
1. ‚úÖ Users will only see their own data
2. ‚úÖ Tenants cannot access other tenants' requests  
3. ‚úÖ Landlords can only see their own properties
4. ‚úÖ The application will be secure for production use

## DO NOT USE THE APPLICATION UNTIL THIS IS FIXED

**The application is currently a security nightmare and should not be used by real users until the RLS policies are properly applied to the database.**
