Message: fix: prevent auto-save on every keystroke in property address form

PROBLEM (Third occurrence):
- PropertyAddressFormSimplified called onChange on EVERY keystroke
- This triggered parent setAddressData, causing constant re-renders
- User experienced laggy typing and premature auto-saves

SOLUTION:
- Form now manages internal state (localData)
- onChange updates local state only - no parent notification
- Parent receives updates only on blur (field exit) or submit
- Smooth typing experience like OnboardingAccountScreen

Pattern copied from working onboarding screens that use
local useState without triggering external effects.

Message: chore: remove all debug logging and mock data from production code

Comprehensive cleanup of testing and debug code across the entire codebase:

## Debug Logging Removed
- propertyAreasService.ts: Removed auth state, fetch, save, and insert debug logging
- PropertyAssetsListScreen.tsx: Removed 47+ console.log statements for render state, photo handling, draft loading
- usePhotoCapture.ts: Removed photo addition and validation logging
- client.ts: Removed maintenance request update logging
- PropertyAreasScreen.tsx: Removed photo processing and save logging
- AppNavigator.tsx: Removed deep link URL logging
- ReviewIssueScreen.tsx: Removed mount and submission logging
- PropertyReviewScreen.tsx: Removed submit state logging
- AddAssetScreen.tsx: Removed params recovery and save logging
- PropertyManagementScreen.tsx: Removed all debug logging
- AssetScanningScreen.tsx: Removed all debug logging
- AuthScreen.tsx: Removed all debug logging
- SignUpScreen.tsx: Removed all debug logging
- PhotoCapture.tsx: Removed all debug logging
- UserProfile.tsx: Removed all debug logging
- Button.tsx: Removed all debug logging

## Mock Data Removed
- ConfirmSubmissionScreen.tsx: Removed mockIssue object and all references, replaced with TODO for real data fetching
- MaintenanceStatusScreen.tsx: Removed getMockRequests function and fallback, now returns empty array on error

## Impact
- Cleaner console output in production
- Smaller bundle size
- Better performance (removed unnecessary logging overhead)
- Clear TODOs where real implementations are needed

Note: Test files, scripts, and logging utility libraries (src/lib/log.ts, etc.) were intentionally preserved as they serve legitimate purposes.

Message: fix: resolve input focus loss in property forms

CRITICAL FIX: Input fields were losing focus after each keystroke, requiring
users to click back into the field to continue typing. This affected both web
and mobile platforms.

Root Cause:
- FormWrapper component was defined inside PropertyAddressFormSimplified's
  render function, causing React to treat it as a new component type on every
  render
- This triggered complete remounting of all child inputs, destroying focus

Changes Made:
1. PropertyAddressFormSimplified.tsx:
   - Move FormWrapper definitions outside component (WebFormWrapper, NativeFormWrapper)
   - Use stable component references to prevent remounting
   - Remove local state complexity - use parent state directly
   - Fix useEffect dependency to prevent unnecessary form resets

2. PropertyBasicsScreen.tsx:
   - Update useEffect to only load draft data when form is empty
   - Prevent draft state changes from resetting user input mid-typing
   - Remove debug logging

3. useOnboardingStatus.ts:
   - Set isLoading=true at start of checkOnboardingStatus to prevent
     premature navigation decisions during async checks
   - Default needsOnboarding=true to prevent UI flash

4. OnboardingWelcomeScreen.tsx:
   - Minor text updates ("MyAI" → "My AI", simplified tagline)

5. AddAssetScreen.tsx:
   - Remove dead code from params recovery

Impact:
- Users can now type continuously without focus interruption
- Smooth typing experience on both web and mobile
- No more keyboard dismissal on every keystroke

Message: refactor: simplify property form fields to essentials only

Removed unnecessary billing/contact fields that were incorrectly added:
- ❌ Full Name
- ❌ Organization
- ❌ Email
- ❌ Phone

Property form now only contains property-specific fields:
- ✅ Property Name (with helpful placeholder)
- ✅ Street Address (renamed from "Address Line 1")
- ✅ Unit / Apt / Suite (clearly marked as optional)
- ✅ City
- ✅ State
- ✅ Postal Code
- ✅ Country

Changes:
- Updated Address type to remove non-property fields
- Removed email/phone normalization functions
- Updated requiredKeys to include propertyName (was incorrectly fullName)
- Added helpful placeholders to guide users
- Improved field labels for clarity

Message: fix: allow half-bathroom increments (0.5) for bathroom count

Bathrooms now increment/decrement by 0.5 instead of 1.0 to support
half-bathrooms (powder rooms). This is standard for real estate since
many homes have 1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 bathrooms.

Changes:
- Add incrementBathrooms() and decrementBathrooms() functions
- Increment/decrement by 0.5 instead of 1
- Minimum value remains 0.5
- Maximum value remains 10

Example: Can now select 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, etc.

Message: refactor: split add property into two screens to eliminate scrolling

Split the "Add New Property" page into two separate screens for better UX:

Screen 1 - Property Address (PropertyBasicsScreen):
- Property Name
- Street Address
- Unit / Apt / Suite
- City
- State
- Postal Code
- Country

Screen 2 - Property Details (PropertyAttributesScreen - NEW):
- Property Type (house, apartment, condo, townhouse)
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms (with 0.5 increments)

Benefits:
- No scrolling required on either screen
- Cleaner, more focused user experience
- Each screen fits on one viewport
- Better mobile UX

Changes:
1. Created PropertyAttributesScreen.tsx for property type/bedrooms/bathrooms
2. Simplified PropertyBasicsScreen to only handle address fields
3. Updated navigation flow: PropertyBasics → PropertyAttributes → PropertyAreas
4. Added PropertyAttributes to LandlordStackParamList
5. Registered PropertyAttributesScreen in navigation stack
6. Updated screen titles/subtitles to be more specific

Message: feat: complete tokenized invite tenant acceptance flow

Implement full support for tokenized invites on the tenant side,
enabling seamless invite acceptance via secure Edge Function calls
while maintaining backward compatibility with legacy propertyId invites.

**Changes:**

1. **PropertyInviteAcceptScreen** - Dual invite flow support:
   - New `validateTokenAndFetchProperty()` calls Edge Function to validate tokens
   - New `acceptTokenizedInvite()` calls Edge Function to create tenant link
   - Legacy `acceptLegacyInvite()` maintains old direct linking
   - Updated `getInviteData()` checks token param first, then propertyId
   - Extracts from route params or deep linking URLs
   - Displays property details from validated token response

2. **PendingInviteService** - Cross-platform invite persistence:
   - Changed interface to support `{ type: 'token' | 'legacy', value, timestamp }`
   - Platform-aware storage (localStorage on web, AsyncStorage on native)
   - Backward compatibility migration for old format (just propertyId string)
   - Deprecated `getPendingPropertyId()` kept for compatibility
   - 1-hour expiration for pending invites

3. **TenantHomeScreen** - Pending invite router:
   - Checks pending invite type after auth
   - For tokenized invites: redirects to PropertyInviteAcceptScreen with token
   - For legacy invites: uses old direct linking API call
   - Handles both flows gracefully with proper error handling

4. **AppNavigator** - Deep linking and pending invite orchestration:
   - Added `token` parameter to deep linking config (alongside legacy `property`)
   - Handles pending tokenized invites with `token:` prefix
   - Clears pending invite after processing to prevent replay
   - Added onboarding flow freeze to prevent re-checks during landlord setup

**Flow:**
1. User clicks invite link → PropertyInviteAcceptScreen
2. If not authenticated → save pending invite (token or propertyId)
3. User signs up/logs in → AppNavigator detects pending invite
4. TenantHomeScreen checks type and routes appropriately:
   - Token: → PropertyInviteAcceptScreen (validates + accepts)
   - Legacy: → Direct API link

**Security:**
- Tokens validated server-side via Edge Function
- User session required for acceptance (authenticated Edge Function call)
- RLS policies enforced in database
- Idempotent acceptance (already_linked handled gracefully)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Legacy propertyId invites still work
- Old pending invite format migrated automatically
- Deprecated methods kept with warnings
