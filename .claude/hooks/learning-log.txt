Message: fix: handle deleted files in secret scanner to prevent hook errors

The secret scanner was failing when trying to scan files that were deleted
in the commit (like claude.me and my_ai_landlord_project_plan.md). Added
proper handling using git cat-file -e to check if a file exists in the
index before attempting to scan it.

Message: fix: optimize Supabase RLS policies for performance and security

- Consolidate multiple SELECT policies into single policies with OR conditions
- Wrap current_setting() calls with (SELECT ...) for better performance
- Add ::text casting for proper clerk_user_id comparison
- Schema-qualify all table names with public.
- Fix get_current_user_profile() to return jsonb instead of profiles type
- Set search_path = public for functions instead of empty string
- Add DROP POLICY IF EXISTS statements for clean migration
- Split FOR ALL policies into separate INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies

This resolves all 39 Supabase linter warnings for auth_rls_initplan and multiple_permissive_policies issues.
