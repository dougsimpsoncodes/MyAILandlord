Message: feat: UI consistency overhaul + terminology updates

Requests Pages:
- Unified design pattern for landlord and tenant request screens
- Added tabbed filters (New, In Progress, Completed) to both
- Consistent status badges, colors, and terminology

- Both pages now titled "Requests" with matching tab labels

Status Fixes:
- Fixed status value mismatches (pending/completed vs new/resolved)
- Aligned status colors: pending=orange, in_progress=blue, completed=green
- Capitalized status text consistently

Terminology Updates:
- "Photos & Assets" → "Rooms & Inventory"
- "Asset" → "Item" throughout property screens
- "Maintenance" tab → "Requests" tab for landlord

TypeScript:
- Added skipLibCheck and esModuleInterop to tsconfig
- Silenced dependency type errors while maintaining strict mode
