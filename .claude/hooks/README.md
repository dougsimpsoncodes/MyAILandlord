# Contextual Development Assistant Hook

## Overview

The Contextual Development Assistant is an intelligent hook system that understands the My AI Landlord business domain and automatically provides synthesized guidance from your 10-advisor team.

## What Makes This Hook Ultra-High-Value

### üß† Business Context Intelligence
- **Understands Intent**: Knows the difference between tenant-facing stress reduction vs landlord efficiency optimization
- **Domain Awareness**: Recognizes property management workflows, maintenance patterns, and user roles
- **Contextual Routing**: Automatically engages the right advisors based on what you're actually building

### ‚ö° Multi-Advisor Synthesis
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolves contradictions between security, UX, and performance recommendations
- **Unified Guidance**: Provides coherent advice from multiple expert perspectives
- **Priority Intelligence**: Knows when security trumps UX, and when UX trumps complexity

### üìà Compound Learning
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns which advice leads to successful implementations
- **Adaptive Guidance**: Gets smarter with each commit
- **Institutional Knowledge**: Builds project-specific expertise that persists

## Installation

```bash
# Install the hook system
./.claude/hooks/install-hooks.sh

# Verify installation
cat .claude/hooks/learning-log.txt
```

## How It Works

### 1. Context Detection
When you modify files, the hook analyzes:
- **File patterns**: `src/screens/tenant/` ‚Üí tenant experience context
- **Content analysis**: Authentication code ‚Üí security-critical context
- **Business logic**: Property management ‚Üí landlord workflow context

### 2. Advisor Orchestration
Based on context, automatically engages relevant advisors:
- **Tenant UX changes**: UX Design Advisor + React Native Expert + Security Auditor
- **Landlord analytics**: Data Analytics Advisor + UX Design Advisor + Security Auditor
- **API security**: Security Auditor + Supabase Specialist + Git Security Guardian

### 3. Intelligent Synthesis
Combines advisor insights with conflict resolution:
- **Security First**: Security recommendations always take precedence
- **Context-Aware Priorities**: Tenant stress reduction vs landlord efficiency optimization
- **Mobile-First**: React Native constraints influence all other guidance

## Business Context Recognition

### Tenant Experience Context
**Triggers on**: 
- `src/screens/tenant/ReportIssueScreen.tsx`
- `src/components/MaintenanceRequest/`
- Any "maintenance request" or "issue report" content

**Guidance Focus**:
- Simplicity and stress reduction (tenant is frustrated when reporting issues)
- Voice/photo input optimization
- Clear error messaging and status updates
- Accessibility for users under stress

### Landlord Experience Context
**Triggers on**:
- `src/screens/landlord/DashboardScreen.tsx`
- `src/components/Analytics/`
- Property management workflows

**Guidance Focus**:
- Data-driven insights and KPI optimization
- Batch operations and efficiency
- Multi-property management patterns
- Business intelligence and reporting

### Security-Critical Context
**Triggers on**:
- Authentication flows
- API client modifications
- Database access patterns
- Token handling

**Guidance Focus**:
- Row Level Security validation
- Input sanitization requirements
- Token security best practices
- GDPR/privacy compliance

## Example Output

```
ü§ñ Contextual Development Assistant activated...
üìÅ Analyzing 3 changed files...
üéØ Business contexts detected: TENANT_EXPERIENCE, SECURITY_CRITICAL
üë• Advisors engaged: ux-design-advisor, security-auditor, react-native-expert

üìã Contextual Guidance:

CRITICAL: Security + UX
Tenant security interface change. Balance security requirements with user 
experience. Avoid security friction for stressed users.
Advisors: security-auditor, ux-design-advisor

HIGH: UX
Tenant-facing change detected. Focus on simplicity and stress reduction. 
Consider voice/photo input options and clear error messaging.
Advisors: ux-design-advisor, react-native-expert

## Configuration

### Context Priorities
Edit `.claude/hooks/config.json`:

```json
{
  "contextualAssistant": {
    "contexts": {
      "tenant": {
        "priority": "user_experience",
        "advisors": ["ux-design-advisor", "react-native-expert", "security-auditor"]
      },
      "landlord": {
        "priority": "efficiency", 
        "advisors": ["data-analytics-advisor", "ux-design-advisor", "security-auditor"]
      }
    },
    "conflictResolution": {
      "securityFirst": true,
      "userExperienceOverComplexity": true
    }
  }
}
```
