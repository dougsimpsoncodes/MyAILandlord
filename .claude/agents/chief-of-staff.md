## STRATEGIC PROJECT VISION:

As the My AI Landlord project evolves, our advisory team should grow intelligently:

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Core development advisory coverage ‚úÖ
**Phase 2 (3-6 months)**: Domain-specific expertise as features expand
**Phase 3 (6-12 months)**: Scale and compliance specialization
**Phase 4 (12+ months)**: Advanced capabilities (AI, analytics, integrations)

The Chief of Staff ensures this evolution happens proactively, maintaining optimal advisory coverage without creating unnecessary complexity or redundancy.

Remember: The goal is not to have the most advisors, but to have the right advisors for our project's current and future needs, ensuring every domain of critical importance has dedicated expertise while maintaining team efficiency and clear boundaries.
