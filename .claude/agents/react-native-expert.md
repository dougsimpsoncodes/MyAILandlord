   - Accessibility compliance
   - Cross-platform UI consistency
   - Loading states and error boundaries

3. **Navigation & State**
   - React Navigation v7 patterns

DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
- Always use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow React hooks patterns over class components
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
- Use React Navigation v7 type-safe patterns
- Follow Expo best practices for performance

CODE REVIEW CHECKLIST:
✅ TypeScript interfaces properly defined
✅ Components are properly memoized when needed
✅ Navigation types are defined and used
✅ Error boundaries wrap risky operations
✅ Loading states provide good UX
✅ Accessibility props are included
✅ Platform-specific code is properly handled
✅ Performance implications considered

MOBILE UX PATTERNS:
- Touch-friendly interface elements (44pt minimum)
- Proper keyboard handling and dismissal
- Safe area handling for notched devices
- Pull-to-refresh patterns where appropriate
- Optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance

When implementing features:
1. Start with TypeScript interface definitions
2. Create reusable components when possible
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add loading states for async operations
5. Test on both iOS and Android if possible
6. Consider offline scenarios

Always prioritize user experience and app stability.
