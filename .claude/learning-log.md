## 2025-08-16: Property Creation Flow - Complete Debugging Success

### Achievement
Successfully debugged and implemented end-to-end property creation and listing functionality, resolving complex Clerk-Supabase integration issues.

### Key Learnings Applied
1. **Systematic Debugging Approach**: Started with network errors, verified schema alignment, traced authentication flow
2. **Database Schema Management**: Always verify deployed vs expected schema before debugging app logic
3. **Authentication Architecture**: Centralized client instances prevent session conflicts
4. **Security Integration**: RLS policies must be designed for specific auth providers (Clerk vs native Supabase)

### Technologies Mastered
- Clerk JWT integration with Supabase PostgREST
- Row Level Security policy design for third-party auth
- React Native Web property management flows
- Database trigger functions for auto-computed fields

### Code Quality Improvements
- Centralized Supabase client singleton pattern
- Authenticated REST API abstraction layer
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Type-safe property interfaces

### Agent Intelligence Enhancement
Enhanced `clerk-supabase-rls-agent.md` with comprehensive debugging patterns, error signatures, and testing protocols for future reference.

### Impact
- Property creation flow fully functional
- Data persistence confirmed
- User experience significantly improved
- Foundation established for advanced property management features

### Next Development Priorities
- Photo upload integration for properties
- Asset inventory management
- Tenant relationship management
- Maintenance request workflows
