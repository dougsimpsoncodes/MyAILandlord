# Codebase Review Plan

- [x] **`package.json` Analysis:** Review dependencies for outdated or insecure packages. Check scripts for any potential issues.
- [x] **Security Audit:** Run the `security:audit` and `security:check-secrets` scripts to identify any immediate security vulnerabilities.
- [x] **Code Quality Checks:** Run the `lint:ts` and `typecheck` scripts to assess the overall code quality and identify any existing issues.
- [x] **Review Key Files:**
    - [x] `App.tsx`: The main entry point of the application.
    - [x] `src/AppNavigator.tsx`: The main navigation component.
    - [x] `src/context/ClerkAuthContext.tsx`: The Clerk authentication context.
    - [x] `src/services/supabase/client.ts`: The Supabase client configuration.
- [ ] **Review Folder Structure:** Analyze the project's folder structure to understand how the code is organized.
- [ ] **Review CI/CD:** Check for any CI/CD configuration files to understand the project's build and deployment process.
- [ ] **Summarize Findings:** Provide a summary of the findings and recommendations for improvement.
