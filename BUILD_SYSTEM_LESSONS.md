# üîß Build System Lessons: Native Development Best Practices

## Executive Summary

This document captures critical lessons learned about React Native + Expo build system management, based on real-world debugging experiences with concurrent builds, configuration updates, and native compilation issues.

## üö® Key Discovery: Build System State Management

### The Problem We Encountered
1. **Concurrent Build Lock**: "database is locked - Possibly there are two concurrent builds running"
2. **Stale Build Artifacts**: Configuration changes not reflected in builds
3. **Xcode DerivedData Conflicts**: Multiple build processes fighting for resources
4. **Configuration Propagation Delays**: Updated app.json not affecting native builds

## üìö Critical Lessons Learned

### 1. Build System Is Stateful
**What we learned:**
- Xcode maintains build databases that can lock
- Multiple `expo run:ios` commands create concurrent builds
- DerivedData persists between builds causing stale configurations

**Solution:**
```bash
# Always check for running builds before starting new ones
ps aux | grep -E "(expo|xcodebuild)" | grep -v grep

# Kill any existing build processes
pkill -f "expo run:ios" || true
pkill -f xcodebuild || true
```

### 2. Configuration Changes Require Clean Builds
**What we learned:**
- Changing URL schemes in app.json doesn't automatically propagate
- Native configuration files are cached in build artifacts
- Incremental builds may not pick up critical changes

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean build artifacts when configuration changes
rm -rf ios/build
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyAILandlord-*

# Then run fresh build
npx expo run:ios
```

### 3. Build Lock Recovery Protocol
**What we learned:**
- Xcode build database locks prevent new builds
- Simply killing processes doesn't always release locks
- Manual cleanup is often required

**Recovery steps:**
```bash
# 1. Stop all build processes
pkill -f "expo run:ios"
pkill -f xcodebuild

# 2. Clean build artifacts
rm -rf ios/build
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*

# 3. Restart Metro (if needed)
pkill -f metro
npx expo start --clear

# 4. Run fresh build
npx expo run:ios
```

### 4. Configuration Update Checklist
**What we learned:**
- Configuration updates have a specific order of operations
- Missing any step causes authentication failures
- Build system doesn't validate configuration consistency

**Proper sequence:**
1. Update environment variables (.env)
2. Update app configuration (app.json)
3. Clean all build artifacts
4. Run fresh native build
5. Verify configuration in built app

### 5. Build Process Monitoring
**What we learned:**
- Build timeouts don't always mean failure
- Processes can hang without visible errors
- Multiple build stages can fail silently

**Monitoring approach:**
```bash
# Check if build is actually running
ps aux | grep xcodebuild

# Monitor build output
tail -f ios/build/Build/Intermediates.noindex/*.log

# Check for locked resources
lsof | grep build.db
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Preventive Measures

### Before Starting Any Build
1. **Check for existing builds**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep -E "(expo|xcodebuild)"
   ```

2. **Clean if configuration changed**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ios/build ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
   ```

3. **Verify environment variables loaded**
   ```bash
   npx expo start | grep "env: export"
   ```

### During Build Issues
1. **Don't run multiple builds** - Always kill existing before starting new
2. **Watch for lock errors** - Immediately stop and clean if database locked
3. **Monitor progress** - Builds should show continuous compilation output

### After Configuration Changes
1. **Always clean build** - Don't trust incremental builds for config changes
2. **Verify in built app** - Check Info.plist for URL schemes
3. **Test immediately** - Confirm configuration applied correctly

## üìã Build System Checklist

### Pre-Build
- [ ] No existing build processes running
- [ ] Build artifacts cleaned if config changed
- [ ] Environment variables properly set
- [ ] Metro bundler not conflicting

### During Build
- [ ] Single build process only
- [ ] Continuous compilation output
- [ ] No database lock errors
- [ ] Build progress advancing

### Post-Build
- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] Configuration changes applied
- [ ] No stale cached behaviors
- [ ] Authentication flows working

## üö® Common Build System Failures

### 1. Database Lock Error
**Symptom:** "database is locked Possibly there are two concurrent builds"
**Cause:** Multiple build processes or orphaned locks
**Fix:** Kill all processes, clean DerivedData

### 2. Configuration Not Applied
**Symptom:** Old behavior despite config changes
**Cause:** Incremental build using cached artifacts
**Fix:** Full clean build required

### 3. Build Hangs Indefinitely
**Symptom:** No progress after initial setup
**Cause:** Resource contention or corrupted cache
**Fix:** Kill, clean, restart

### 4. Simulator Not Updating
**Symptom:** Old version runs despite new build
**Cause:** App not properly installed/replaced
**Fix:** Delete app from simulator, clean build

## üîß Build System Best Practices

1. **One Build at a Time** - Never run concurrent iOS builds
2. **Clean for Config** - Any configuration change needs clean build
3. **Monitor Progress** - Watch for compilation output
4. **Verify Changes** - Test immediately after build completes
5. **Document Issues** - Add new failures to this document

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Build system state is complex** - Multiple caches and databases involved
2. **Configuration propagation is fragile** - Many points of failure
3. **Clean builds are safer** - When in doubt, clean everything
4. **Process management is critical** - Orphaned processes cause issues
5. **Verification is mandatory** - Always test configuration changes
