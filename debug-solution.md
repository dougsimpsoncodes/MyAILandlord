# Placeholder Text Debug Solution

## Issue Analysis
The PropertyBasicsScreen is showing hardcoded placeholder text despite implementing PropertyAddressFormSimplified with empty placeholders.

## Root Cause Discovered
There was a JavaScript error in PropertyBasicsScreen.tsx at line 552: `validateField('type', type.id)` - this function doesn't exist, causing the component to fail rendering.

## Fix Applied
1. **Fixed the undefined function error** in PropertyBasicsScreen.tsx:
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (causing error):
   validateField('type', type.id);
   
   // AFTER (fixed):
   const newErrors = { ...errors };
   delete newErrors.type;
   setErrors(newErrors);
   ```

2. **Debug marker added** to PropertyAddressFormSimplified (lines 178-180):
   ```typescript
   <View style={{ backgroundColor: 'red', padding: 10, marginBottom: 20 }}>
     <Text style={{ color: 'white', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>DEBUG: PropertyAddressFormSimplified IS RENDERING</Text>
   </View>
   ```

## Expected Result
After fixing the JavaScript error and restarting the server:
1. The red debug banner should appear at the top of the form
2. All placeholder text should be empty (no "San Francisco", "123 Main Street", etc.)
3. The form should render PropertyAddressFormSimplified component properly

## Verification Steps
1. Open browser to localhost:8081
2. Navigate to Property Basics screen (step 1 of 5)
3. Look for the red debug banner at the top
4. Verify all input fields have empty placeholders
5. Test that autofill works properly for address fields (not property name)

## Files Modified
- `/src/screens/landlord/PropertyBasicsScreen.tsx` - Fixed validateField error
- `/src/components/forms/PropertyAddressFormSimplified.tsx` - Added debug marker

## Alternative Components Found
- `/src/components/forms/AddressForm.tsx` - Contains hardcoded placeholders
- `/src/components/forms/PropertyAddressForm.tsx` - Original form (if it exists)

The issue was likely that the JavaScript error prevented PropertyAddressFormSimplified from rendering, causing a fallback to show cached or default content.
