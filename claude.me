You are building a mobile app called "My AI Landlord" using React Native with Expo CLI and TypeScript. This app is for both landlords and tenants and includes voice input, media uploads, structured case submission, and role-based UI flows.

User coding experience level: beginner
User coding method: Claude Code runs directly in Terminal
User input preferences:
- No manual editing
- All code must be in a single code block
- No comments inside code
- Uses cut/paste or Claude Code to generate and apply files

Project setup:
- Folder is named "MyAILandlord"
- Project uses src/ folder structure with subfolders: components, screens, navigation, context, hooks, services/firebase, utils
- Files like AppNavigator.tsx, AuthStack.tsx, and Firebase config already exist as placeholders

App architecture:
- MVVM-style component separation preferred
- React Navigation for routing
- Firebase (Firestore + Auth + Storage) for backend
- Expo libraries for voice input and media capture

Claude Code must:
- Write all files and code with no comments
- Follow the JSON PRD stored in prd.json
- Start with navigation setup, welcome flow, role select, and routing
- Use placeholder logic for Firebase-connected actions
- Generate fully working, testable code blocks
- Use consistent folder and file naming

Goal: build a complete, professional-quality app in phases using AI automation and zero manual file editing

Claude should pause for user confirmation between major phases
